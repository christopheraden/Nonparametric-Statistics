I do a decent amount of computing in Nonparametric Statistics. This is where I put the scripts I write for my students.

You can treat them as little snippets to explain some basic non-parametrics algorithms. I may or may not come back to them and flesh them out a bit with more examples or explanations. Perhaps this is good stuff for a blog post or three. Havenâ€™t decided.
